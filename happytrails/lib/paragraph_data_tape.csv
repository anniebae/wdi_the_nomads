1,"This hike traverses a spectacular six-mile section of the Appalachian Trail. The first two miles are relatively level, but the last four miles involve many short but steep climbs and descents, as the trail traverses a series of rock outcrops.",0,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.161407,2014-11-25 03:24:17.161407
2,"From the parking area, follow the white-blazed Appalachian Trail as it heads south into the woods, crossing several stone walls. In 0.4 mile, the trail crosses a seasonal stream and climbs to cross under a power line, with an interesting outcrop of puddingstone conglomerate rock on the left.",1,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.164563,2014-11-25 03:24:17.164563
3,"The trail now climbs steeply to the crest of the ridge, then begins to descend, passing more puddingstone rock outcrops on the left. After crossing a seasonal stream, the outlet of a marsh to the right, the trail begins a gradual climb. It soon levels off, bears right at a double blaze (an unmarked path to the left leads to a clearing atop a large rock outcrop, with several cedars and a limited east-facing view). A short distance beyond, the trail passes through an area with hemlocks and mountain laurel thickets.",2,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.166357,2014-11-25 03:24:17.166357
4,"About two miles from the start of the hike, you'll reach a junction where the blue-blazed Village Vista Trail starts on the left. This trail leads down to the Village of Greenwood Lake, but you should continue ahead on the white-blazed Appalachian Trail. A short distance beyond, the trail emerges onto open conglomerate rock ledges on the east side of the ridge. Continue ahead, climbing slightly, until you reach an outcrop that offers a panoramic view over Greenwood Lake.

6,"After crossing another seasonal stream, the trail follows a rock ledge and then descends through thick hemlocks to reach a clearing next to Cascade Brook, which is crossed on rocks. After a level stretch, it climbs to a rock outcrop (with no views), then descends through hemlocks, mountain laurel and rhododendron, crossing several branches of a stream at the base of the descent.&nbsp;",5,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.172593,2014-11-25 03:24:17.172593
7,"The trail now begins to climb, soon passing a huge rock cairn at the start of a long rock outcrop. For the next mile or so, the trail traverses a series of rock outcrops, with many short but steep climbs and descents. This is a relatively difficult but quite spectacular section of trail. There are some views to the east over the hills of Sterling Forest but, for the most part, views of Greenwood Lake are blocked by the trees.",6,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.175019,2014-11-25 03:24:17.175019
8,"After a short stretch through the woods, the trail climbs to a massive rock outcrop, again marked with a huge cairn. This outcrop offers a 360-degree view (although trees obscure the view of Greenwood Lake), and it is a good place to stop and take a break. The trail descends from this outcrop and continues through the woods, traversing a number of smaller outcrops.",7,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.177389,2014-11-25 03:24:17.177389
9,"Finally, you'll climb to the top of a large rock outcrop that offers an expansive view to the southeast over Greenwood Lake. You’ll want to take a break here to contemplate this spectacular panorama. Just beyond, there is a west-facing view, and then you’ll begin a very steep descent, with a ladder making it possible to traverse a near-vertical rock slab.&nbsp;",8,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.179329,2014-11-25 03:24:17.179329
10,"After crossing a seasonal stream, the trail descends gradually. It crosses the wide Furnace Brook on rocks, with a cascade to the left, and continues on a nearly level footpath. After crossing another seasonal stream on rocks, the trail passes a wetland on the right and climbs gently along a rocky footpath that resembles a streambed. Rock outcrops soon appear on both sides of the trail, and the trail continues through a narrow valley.",9,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.181714,2014-11-25 03:24:17.181714
11,"Soon, the trail turns right and climbs out of the valley. Near the top, the trail turns sharply left, but you should take a short detour to the right to reach the top of a rock outcrop with views to the north, east and south. Although Greenwood Lake is not visible from this vantage point, it offers the broadest view on the hike.&nbsp;",10,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.184034,2014-11-25 03:24:17.184034
12,"Return to the trail, which soon begins to run along a rock ledge. A short distance beyond, the blue-blazed Zig Zag Trail, which leads to Cascade Lake Park in the Town of Warwick, begins on the right. You should continue straight ahead. The trail now climbs to Prospect Rock, an outstanding vantage point over Greenwood Lake, with the hills of Sterling Forest beyond.",11,1,2014-11-25 03:24:17.186343,2014-11-25 03:24:17.186343

15,"<br />From the Hoyt Road parking area, cross Hoyt Road and head north on the white-blazed Appalachian Trail.&nbsp; You will soon pass a short side trail on the left, which leads through a small field to a large hiker parking lot off of NY-55.&nbsp; This provides another parking option if the small Hoyt Road lot is full.&nbsp; Very soon you will notice a sign on a tree indicating the beginning of the Appalachian Trail through Connecticut, although you will be hiking in New York again later on.&nbsp; A map box, several of which are located along this route, is probably stocked with maps.&nbsp; Although these maps offer a very nice overview of the entire section of the Appalachian Trail that passes through Connecticut, it gives no details specific to this hike.&nbsp; Best to print out the Cross Thayer Brook at 10.2 miles then start the uphill trek on Mt. Algo.&nbsp; You will reach the high point in .4 mile.&nbsp; Now the rocky trail will descend continuously and soon your car will soon come into view way down at the bottom of the trail.",0,2,2014-11-25 03:24:17.19478,2014-11-25 03:24:17.19478

369,"At first, the Catfish Loop Trail descends gently. After crossing two streams, the trail begins a steady climb, and it passes a register box on a tree to the right of the trail (please sign the register). It crosses another stream and follows along the park boundary (marked by “posted” signs to the left of the trail) for some distance. Soon, it reaches the highest point on this section of the ridge, which is marked by a cairn.",2,37,2014-11-25 03:24:17.935522,2014-11-25 03:24:17.935522
370,"After a relatively level stretch, the Catfish Loop Trail crosses the white-blazed A.T. (this junction is also marked by a cairn). The trail now descends steadily through mountain laurel thickets. It crosses a woods road (blazed yellow as a horse trail) and, a short distance beyond, crosses a stream on rocks. Signs here indicate that, to the right, the area is closed to protect a wildlife habitat.",3,37,2014-11-25 03:24:17.93722,2014-11-25 03:24:17.93722
371,"After a gradual climb, the trail reaches the most interesting point on the hike, where it goes through a narrow passage between large lichen-covered boulders. From the top of the boulders to the right there is a panoramic west-facing view, with Crows Nest and Storm King Mountains visible on the west side of the Hudson River. You’ve now hiked for about two miles, and this attractive spot Is a good place to take a break.",4,37,2014-11-25 03:24:17.938882,2014-11-25 03:24:17.938882
372,"Continue ahead on the Catfish Loop Trail, which descends through mountain laurel, climbs a rock outcrop, then descends steeply. The trail crosses several more rock outcrops and passes through dense mountain laurel thickets. After going by a cliff to the left, the trail bends sharply to the right and begins to head north on a relatively level footpath.",5,37,2014-11-25 03:24:17.94047,2014-11-25 03:24:17.94047
373,"Nearly three miles into the hike, the trail crosses a stream and goes through a gap in a stone wall. It now begins to climb, following a rock outcrop that overlooks a valley to the left. You’ll notice an abundance of rock walls near the trail in this area, and it is hard to believe that this land that appears so inhospitable to settlement was once devoted to agricultural pursuits. There are several limited west-facing viewpoints along this section of the trail, with the West Hudson Highlands visible in the distance.",6,37,2014-11-25 03:24:17.942135,2014-11-25 03:24:17.942135
374,"Soon, the trail begins to parallel a stone wall on the left, which marks the park boundary (note the “posted” signs on the opposite side of the wall). After a while, the blazes bear right, away from the wall. A short distance beyond, be alert as the blazed trail turns sharply right (do not follow an unmarked trail that continues straight ahead).",7,37,2014-11-25 03:24:17.943983,2014-11-25 03:24:17.943983
375,"The trail now crosses a stream and continues through dense mountain laurel thickets. After some short ups and downs, you will notice Duck Pond through the trees to the left. The trail makes a very sharp bend and nearly doubles back on itself, heading south and then east, and reaching a large rock outcrop with a view of the valley below to the left.",8,37,2014-11-25 03:24:17.945929,2014-11-25 03:24:17.945929
376,"From the outcrop, the Catfish Loop Trail descends steeply to the valley below. It&nbsp;crosses a wide stream on rocks, goes over a minor rise, then begins a steep, steady climb of about 150 vertical feet. Upon reaching the crest of the ridge, the trail goes down a little, regains the lost altitude and levels off. A short distance beyond, you’ll pass another trail register box on the right side of the trail (please sign).",9,37,2014-11-25 03:24:17.947695,2014-11-25 03:24:17.947695
377,"Soon, the trail crosses a yellow-blazed woods road. This is the same horse trail that you crossed earlier in the hike. The Catfish Loop Trail now climbs briefly to a rock outcrop, descends steadily through the woods, and climbs once more to reach to end at a junction with the white-blazed Appalachian Trail,. Turn left and follow the A.T. for a short distance to reach Dennytown Road. The parking area where the hike began is on the opposite side of the road.",10,37,2014-11-25 03:24:17.949383,2014-11-25 03:24:17.949383
378,"Cross to the north side of the road and proceed north on the red-blazed Charcoal Burners Trail (named for the men who felled trees in the area during the nineteenth century and carefully burned them to make charcoal). The trail briefly parallels the road, then bears left and heads into the woods. Soon, you’ll reach the eastern end of the yellow-blazed Perkins Trail, but you should continue ahead on the red-blazed Charcoal Burners Trail. The relatively level trail passes through thickets of mountain laurel, with an understory of blueberry bushes.",0,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.953768,2014-11-25 03:24:17.953768
379,"In about two-thirds of a mile, you’ll reach a cairn (rock pile) that marks the start of the white-blazed Cabot Trail. Turn left and follow the Cabot Trail, which descends gradually, reaching Jordan Pond in half a mile. Two short side trails lead down to the pond; the second trail (which leaves to the right just beyond the crossing of the pond’s inlet) reaches the shoreline at a rock ledge, with a broad view over the pond. A bench has been placed here for hikers to rest and contemplate the bucolic scene.",1,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.955636,2014-11-25 03:24:17.955636
380,"Continue ahead on the Cabot Trail, which soon goes by a large rock outcrop and begins to ascend. After passing between old stone walls, the trail emerges onto a clearing. Here, the yellow-blazed Perkins Trail comes in from the left. The Cabot Trail ends here, and you should continue ahead on the yellow-blazed trail, briefly following a wide, grassy road. Watch carefully for a double-blaze, which marks a right turn.",2,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.957377,2014-11-25 03:24:17.957377
438,"After climbing once more to reach the highest point on the ridge, the S-BM Trail begins a steady descent of about 750 vertical feet. It soon reaches a very steep section, where extreme care should be taken if the trail is wet, icy or snow-covered. The grade then moderates somewhat. About halfway down, the trail crosses a stream and joins an old woods road, with more gentle grades. The road is eroded in places, and some stretches of the trail have been routed away from the road.",7,44,2014-11-25 03:24:18.075222,2014-11-25 03:24:18.075222
381,"Just beyond, you’ll come to a unlocked gate – the first of several you’ll encounter in this portion of the hike. This section of the trail crosses private property and several active fields, and you are requested to leave each gate in the position (locked or unlocked) that you find it in. Follow the trail as it turns left on a dirt road for about 200 feet, then turns right and reaches a wooden gate (before coming to a road that goes off to the right). After passing through this gate, you’ll emerge alongside an open field – in summer, filled with a multitude of wildflowers. Continue ahead on a footpath, with a fence on the right and an old stone wall on the left, and views to the right over the ridge to the north. You’ll pass a large horse barn on the left.",3,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.959071,2014-11-25 03:24:17.959071
382,"After following a path between two fences, the trail turns right and follows along the right side of another large field, used for growing hay. As you reach the crest of the hill, views appear over a large lake below. After descending for a short distance, bear left on a farm road that crosses the field (to the right, a double yellow blaze on a fence post indicates the turn). Continue along the farm road as it passes another gate and crosses a third field (due to the absence of trees, there are few blazes along this section of the trail). Enter the woods at the end of the field, bear right at the next fork, and emerge onto a fourth field. Here, the trail bears right, skirting the perimeter of the field, then continues along the road, soon re-entering the woods at a gap in a stone wall.",4,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.961048,2014-11-25 03:24:17.961048
383,"After reaching a limited viewpoint to the north and west from a rock outcrop, the trail begins a steady descent through mountain laurel thickets. Soon, you’ll hear the sounds of traffic, as the trail comes close to Route 301. Near the base of the descent, the trail swings sharply to the right, heads away from the busy road, and begins to parallel Clove Creek. For half a mile, the trail runs along this attractive watercourse. This is about the halfway point of the hike. The trail then bears left, crosses the stream on a wooden bridge, crosses the private Glynwood Road (a little-used dirt road), and climbs rather steeply to a grassy woods&nbsp;road.",5,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.96279,2014-11-25 03:24:17.96279
384,"A red-blazed trail begins on the left, but you should turn right to continue along the yellow-blazed Perkins Trail, which follows this grassy road. Soon, you’ll come to a T-intersection, where the yellow-blazed trail turns left. In another 150 feet, it reaches a junction with the blue-blazed Fahnestock Trail. The Perkins Trail turns left here, but you should bear right, leaving the Perkins Trail, and follow the blue blazes of the Fahnestock Trail. A short distance ahead, you’ll pass a large pond to the right, visible through the trees.",6,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.964562,2014-11-25 03:24:17.964562
385,"Just beyond the northern end of the pond, the trail bears right, crosses the pond’s inlet on a culvert and a moss-covered cement bridge, and begins a steady climb. Watch carefully for a right turn at the crest of the rise, where the trail leaves the woods road and heads into the woods on a footpath. The trail descends a switchback, climbs a rock outcrop, and continues to ascend more gently through mountain laurel. Eventually, it turns right onto a woods road. The trail briefly turns left onto another woods road, then turns right and continues on a footpath through dense barberry bushes.",7,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.966214,2014-11-25 03:24:17.966214
386,"After a moderate climb, the blue-blazed Fahnestock Trail turns right onto a wide, grassy woods road. A short distance beyond, the red-blazed Charcoal Burners Trail joins from the left. Continue along the joint blue-and-red trail, which descends to Beaver Pond. The trail comes out along the shore of this beautiful pond, with a panoramic view over the pond. This is a good spot to take a break..",8,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.967906,2014-11-25 03:24:17.967906
387,"The trail now turns right, descends to cross the outlet of the pond, then climbs through highbush blueberry bushes and dense mountain laurel thickets to reach another junction. Here, the blue-blazed Fahnestock Trail turns left, but you should continue ahead and follow the red-blazed Charcoal Burners Trail for about a mile to Route 301, where the hike began.",9,38,2014-11-25 03:24:17.969539,2014-11-25 03:24:17.969539
388,"Walk back along the paved road to a junction with a grassy road on the left. Turn left on the grassy road and, almost immediately, you’ll reach a gate. A triple-white blaze on the gate marks the start of the white-blazed School Mountain Road (a sign on the gate shows the route of the Hudson Trail, which you’ll also be following for the first part of the hike). Continue ahead along the road, soon joining the blue-blazed Fahnestock Trail. A short distance beyond, the road crosses two streams on steel-plate bridges.",0,39,2014-11-25 03:24:17.973709,2014-11-25 03:24:17.973709
389,"In about half a mile, you’ll notice two stone pillars on the left. The road formerly crossed the stream here on a steel-plate bridge, but the bridge was washed out by Hurricane Irene in August 2011. Turn right, steeply descend to the stream, and cross the stream on two steel I-beams. Just beyond, the blue-blazed Fahnestock Trail turns sharply right, leaving School Mountain Road. Continue along the blue-blazed trail, which parallels the stream, following an old woods road. In 0.2 mile, the woods road leaves the stream, and about half a mile from School Mountain Road, the Fahnestock Trail turns left, leaving the woods road, and begins a rather steep climb of Round Hill on switchbacks.",1,39,2014-11-25 03:24:17.975575,2014-11-25 03:24:17.975575
390,"At the top of the steep climb, the trail reaches a west-facing viewpoint amid red cedars, with the intersection of Routes 9 and 301 directly below, and Bull Hill (Mt. Taurus) in the distance. This is a good place to take a short break. The trail continues up the cedar-studded ridge of Round Hill, climbing gradually.",2,39,2014-11-25 03:24:17.977688,2014-11-25 03:24:17.977688
391,"After following the ridge for about half a mile, crossing several old stone walls, the trail turns right, descends slightly into a shallow ravine, then climbs more steeply on a winding path. It levels off and soon reaches a viewpoint from a rock ledge just below the summit of Round Hill. The view here is to the southwest, with the Bear Mountain Bridge over the Hudson River visible in the distance on a clear day. This is another good spot for a break.",3,39,2014-11-25 03:24:17.979423,2014-11-25 03:24:17.979423
392,"After climbing to reach an east-facing viewpoint over the hills of Fahnestock State Park, with Route 301 visible below and a communications tower to the right, the trail descends rather steeply to a woods road in a valley.

393,"Continue on the Fahnestock Trail as it levels off, crosses a seasonally wet area, then climbs gradually. After a short, steep climb of a rock ledge, the trail passes a west-facing viewpoint through the trees and continues to climb steadily to the crest of another ridge, first rather steeply, then more gradually. There are some east-facing views on the way up, but there are no views from the wooded summit (the highest point on the hike; elevation 1,180 feet), marked by a large lichen-covered boulder to the right of the trail.",5,39,2014-11-25 03:24:17.982696,2014-11-25 03:24:17.982696
439,"At the base of the descent, follow the yellow-blazed S-BM Trail as it turns left onto a level road, the route of the Doodletown Bridle Path. When the yellow blazes go off to the right, continue ahead on the wide bridle path, which soon begins a gradual climb.",8,44,2014-11-25 03:24:18.077338,2014-11-25 03:24:18.077338
395,"Turn left at this intersection, leaving the blue-blazed Fahnestock Trail, and follow the yellow-blazed Perkins Trail, which descends on an old woods road to cross a stream, then continues through an area with many stone walls. It bears left at a fork and continues to descend along a cascading stream, reaching its terminus on School Mountain Road. Turn right onto School Mountain Road, cross a stream on rocks, then immediately turn left onto the red-blazed East Mountain Loop, passing an abandoned farmhouse on the right.",7,39,2014-11-25 03:24:17.98598,2014-11-25 03:24:17.98598
396,"Follow the red-blazed trail along a woods road bordered by stone walls. Soon, the road begins to descend. At the base of the descent, it crosses a stream on rocks in an area in which relics of the former agricultural use are abundant. The area is criss-crossed by a series of stone walls, and just before the stream crossing, the rusted iron wheels of an old farm wagon may be seen to the left of the trail.",8,39,2014-11-25 03:24:17.987716,2014-11-25 03:24:17.987716
397,"The road now begins to climb, passing a stone foundation to the left. Near the top of the rise, follow the red-blazed trail as it turns left, leaving the woods road, and begins a steady ascent of the ridge of East Mountain. After bearing left at the crest of the rise, the trail continues along the summit ridge to reach a panoramic viewpoint just below the summit. The view is to the west and north over the Fishkill Ridge, with South Beacon Mountain (marked by a fire tower) and North Beacon Mountain (the site of several communications towers) directly ahead. This is another good location for a break.",9,39,2014-11-25 03:24:17.989343,2014-11-25 03:24:17.989343

400,"Proceed to the northeast corner of the parking area (to the right of an old stone building) and follow the blue-blazed Three Lakes Trail, which enters the woods, crosses a stream and bears right to parallel it. After passing a swamp on the right, the trail turns left and begins to climb rather steeply. Near the top of the hill, the trail passes an interesting split rock to the right. Just beyond – at the top of the rise – the remains of the Denny Mine may be seen to the right of the trail. You’ll first notice a long, narrow opening, surrounding by piles of tailings (waste rock removed from the mine). If you bushwhack a little further to the northeast, you will reach an even more impressive mine opening – about 100 feet long and 20 feet deep, with the bottom filled with water. Use caution if you wish to explore these mine openings, all of which are to the right (northeast) of the trail.",0,40,2014-11-25 03:24:17.997092,2014-11-25 03:24:17.997092

Continue on the paved road as it turns to gravel, crosses a power cut then skirts by a small reservoir on the left.&nbsp; Entering the woods, the trail becomes rockier and follows to the right of Dry Creek.&nbsp; This area is called Hemlock Gorge but there is an obvious absence of hemlocks.&nbsp; Some remnants litter the forest floor and there are a few very sickly upright specimens at the higher end of Dry Creek, probably in the last stages of succumbing to woolly adelgid infestation, a tragic killer of the once majestic hemlocks.&nbsp; As the trail ascends more steeply, you just might find yourself focusing your attention on the beautiful creek and waterfalls rather than the uphill climb.<br /><br />As you will be following the white-blazed (round white disc) trail for its entire 4.5 miles, keep straight when a yellow-blazed trail comes in from the right at .45 mile.&nbsp; You won’t see the yellow discs at the intersection but you might spot one if you look up that trail.<br /><br />At .65 mile the double white discs indicate a left turn sending you on a rock hop over the creek.&nbsp; Once on the other side, continue along the trail a short distance towards the now louder sounds of crashing water to find a beautiful multi-tiered waterfall.&nbsp; From the waterfall, continue uphill on the white-blazed trail then climb up and over a short, steep dirt mound at .85 mile to arrive at an intersection with a dirt road.&nbsp; Turn left on the dirt road, cross the bridge, then reenter the woods to the right to continue on the white-blazed trail.&nbsp; The trail switchbacks up to multiple views of the City of Beacon, the Hudson River, the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge, and the Shawangunks in front of the Catskills on the horizon.&nbsp; Pay close attention keeping with the white discs when other unmarked trails, as well as the red-blazed Overlook Trail, come and go along the way<br /><br />A rock scramble at 1.5 miles brings you to the summit of Lambs Hill with a nice flat area for taking a break high up above the Hudson Valley.&nbsp; Descending on the other side of Lambs Hill, the white-blazed trail arrives at a woods road junction with the blue-blazed trail at what is affectionately known as “Dozer Junction” for the old, rusty bulldozer that sits off to the side.&nbsp; Continue on the white-blazed trail but remember this junction for your return route, which will be approaching this intersection from the blue-blazed trail to the right.<br /><br />The trail now ascends to follow along the crest of Fishkill Ridge to Bald Hill, identified by benchmarks on the stone walking surface.&nbsp; Views along this route shift to the tree-covered hills to the east.&nbsp; At the end of the ridge, the trail makes a sharp right turn descending along an old woods road carved into the eastern side of Fishkill Ridge below the crest.&nbsp; This road offers a pleasant, easy stroll after working for the views of the first part of the hike.&nbsp; The white-blazed Fishkill Ridge Trail ends at 4.5 miles when it runs into the Wilkinson Memorial Trail.&nbsp; Turn right on this trail, which is blazed with yellow discs. &nbsp;<br /><br />In about a quarter of a mile, after the yellow-blazed trail is interrupted by a brief rock scramble at Hell Hollow with a view of the sheer vertical cliff on the other side of the notch, pass an unmarked junction, then at the next intersection turn right and follow the blue discs back to the bulldozer at Dozer Junction.&nbsp; Turn left on the white-blazed Fishkill Ridge Trail to retrace back to where you parked.&nbsp; When you reach the dirt road, you may turn left on the dirt road, cross the bridge, then turn right into the woods to continue on the white-blazed trail descending sometimes steeply along Dry Creek, or turn right and stay on the dirt road to follow a smoother, more gradual descent back to your car on Pocket Road.</span>",0,42,2014-11-25 03:24:18.038102,2014-11-25 03:24:18.038102

Here, the red-blazed Brook Trail begins to the left, but you should turn right, continuing to follow the blue blazes of the Notch Trail.",3,104,2014-11-25 03:24:19.455353,2014-11-25 03:24:19.455353
1114,"Just beyond the junction, you will pass several concrete and stone ruins on both sides of the trail. These are the remnants of a dairy farm, once operated by the Cornish family. Please use care if you wish to explore these ruins, as there are some steep drop-offs. Past the ruins, the trail goes by a dam and skirts the northwest side of a pond. Just beyond the end of the pond, the Notch Trail turns left, leaving the road, and begins a steep ascent to the crest of Breakneck Ridge, with limited views to the right through the trees. After climbing over rocks and around switchbacks, the Notch Trail reaches the white-blazed Breakneck Ridge Trail at a T-junction.

Continue ahead, and soon you will reach a magnificent 360° viewpoint from one of the highest points on Breakneck Ridge. The Hudson River is visible to the east, with the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge in the distance to the north. The long ridge to the southeast is Bull Hill (Mt. Taurus). The highest point on Breakneck Ridge may be seen to the northeast. In the distance to the north, you can see North Beacon Mountain (with multiple radio towers) and South Beacon Mountain (the higher peak, with a single fire lookout tower).",5,104,2014-11-25 03:24:19.459386,2014-11-25 03:24:19.459386
1116,"After spending some time resting from the steep climbs and taking in the view, follow the white blazes as they turn sharply right and descend steeply from the peak. The trail soon levels off and, in about 500 feet, you will reach a junction with the red-blazed Breakneck Bypass Trail. Watch carefully for this junction, which is marked by three red-on-white blazes on a rock to the right of the trail (there is also a small cairn). Turn right onto the red trail, which climbs over a large rock, and begins to descend. Just ahead, be sure to bear left at a Y-junction, marked by a small cairn. A short distance beyond, there is a view of Sugarloaf Mountain, with Bannerman's Castle on Pollopel Island visible to its left.",6,104,2014-11-25 03:24:19.461246,2014-11-25 03:24:19.461246

1117,"The red trail now descends steadily. After bearing left and passing through a wet area, the grade moderates briefly, but it steepens again after the trail passes another viewpoint over Sugarloaf Mountain. The Breakneck Bypass Trail ends, 0.8 mile from its start, at a junction with the yellow-blazed Wilkinson Memorial Trail. Turn left on the yellow trail, which follows an old woods road (now narrowed to a footpath) downhill. Soon after crossing a stream on a wooden bridge, the trail ends on Route 9D.",7,104,2014-11-25 03:24:19.462979,2014-11-25 03:24:19.462979
1118,"It is possible to leave a second car in a turnout along the road at this point (half a mile north of the Breakneck Ridge tunnel), but a more interesting return option is to take a short ride on the Metro-North Railroad from the Breakneck Ridge station, just to the north. Service to this station is provided only on weekends, and there are only three southbound trains that stop here -- at 1:13 p.m., 4:13 p.m. and 7:17 p.m. (For more information, call Metro-North at 1-800-METRO-INFO, or visit their web site, .)&nbsp;To reach the station, proceed north on Route 9D for 0.25 mile and cross the footbridge that spans the tracks. The station (which is marked by a sign adjacent to a small platform) is about 100 feet south of the footbridge. Take the train one stop to Cold Spring. To return to your car, cross the footbridge over the tracks at the Cold Spring station, and walk north, following a walkway to Main Street. Turn right and follow Main Street uphill for about a mile.

After several switchbacks, you'll pass a pond on the left and then reach a trail junction in the broad saddle between Castle Rock and Sugarloaf Hill. Turn right here, and continue to follow the red blazes, which now mark a footpath that steeply climbs to the summit of Sugarloaf Hill. Just beyond the summit, the trail ends at a rock outcrop, with a magnificent view to the south over the Hudson River and the Bear Mountain Bridge.",1,105,2014-11-25 03:24:19.470667,2014-11-25 03:24:19.470667

Named after a prominent family in the area who donated the land traversed by the trail, the Osborn Loop Trail follows carriage roads of the former estate. The trail climbs gently and, after passing a small pond to the right and a gazebo to the left, reaches a junction with the yellow-blazed Carriage Connector Trail. Continue ahead on the blue-blazed trail, which soon resumes its climb, passing through thick stands of mountain laurel. After leveling off, the Osborn Loop Trail ends a junction with the white-blazed Appalachian Trail. You're now about halfway through the hike (including the side trip to Sugarloaf Hill).",2,105,2014-11-25 03:24:19.4724,2014-11-25 03:24:19.4724
1122,"Proceed straight ahead on the carriage road, now following the white blazes of the Appalachian Trail on a relatively level route. In about 500 feet, you'll notice a blue-blazed side trail on the right, which leads a short distance to a rock outcrop with a limited view over the Hudson River. About a mile beyond, the yellow-blazed Curry Pond Trail leaves to the right. Continue ahead on the Appalachian Trail, which soon begins to descend. After bearing sharply right at a junction with another woods road, it reaches the southern end of the Osborn Loop Trail. The Appalachian Trail turns left here, but you should continue ahead, now once again following the blue blazes of the Osborn Loop Trail.",3,105,2014-11-25 03:24:19.474659,2014-11-25 03:24:19.474659

However, for the most part, the trails lead through quiet, secluded areas, with unusual geologic formations and numerous stone walls – remnants of the area’s former agricultural use. The elevation difference between the highest and lowest points in the sanctuary is only 340 feet, but there are many ups and downs, especially in the latter portion of the hike.
