HIKE is a web application for avid hikers who want to access hike trails more easily but donâ€™t want to deal with the logistical details. This app simplifies the planning and selection processes in hiking by showing a list of hike trails by distance, cost, difficulty, and accessibility based on modes of transportation.

========================================================

The two options on the navbar provide a brief description about the app under 'ABOUT' and a friendly hiker in 'HELLO.'

A user can enter a starting address from where they wish to depart for their hike. Once the address is submitted, a list of trails nearest you will get rendered to the page.

========================================================

Each trail name is a link that opens up a div, using javascript, with a detailed description of the chosen trail. A user can exit out of the trail's info div with the 'X' button on the top left corner, and read about more trails.
